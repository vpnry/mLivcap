The app is now only doing transcript captions. 

Add another button "Live translate" with the translation icon. When click on this icon, it will list options "Transcript only" +  supported languages.

 if the default selected is "Transcript only", or the same language with the selected language. Then only do transcript.
 if different, then do live translation using Translation from Apple.

In the Live translate mode: you should display the transcript and translated 
in paralel like, for example:

Transcript: Guten Morgen!

Translation: Good morning!

(You do not need to include the Translation: and Transcript: prefix)
